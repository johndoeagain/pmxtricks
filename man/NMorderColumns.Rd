\title{Order columns in dataset for use in Nonmem.}
\usage{
NMorderColumns(data, first, last, lower.last = T, chars.last = T,
  nomtime = "NOMTIME", row = "ROW", debug = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataset which columns to reorder.}

\item{first}{Columns that should come before alphabetic
sorting. Default is
c("ROW","ID","NTIM","TIME","EVID","CMT","AMT","RATE","DV","MDV","FLAG","OCC","ROUTE","GRP","TRIAL")}

\item{last}{Columns to sort after alphabetic ordering. Default is
none.}

\item{lower.last}{Should columns which names contain lowercase
characters be moved toward the end? Some people use a standard
of lowercase variables (say "race") being character
representations ("asian", "caucasian", etc.) variables and the
uppercase (1,2,...) being the numeric representation for
Nonmem.}

\item{chars.last}{Should columns which cannot be converted to
numeric be put towards the end? A column can be a character or
a factor in R, but still be valied in Nonmem. So rather than
only looking at the column class, the columns are attempted
converted to numeric. Notice, it will attempted to be
converted to numeric to test wheather Nonmem will be able to
make sense of it, but the values in the resulting dataset will
be untouched. No values will be edited. If TRUE, logicals will
always be put last.}

\item{nomtime}{The name of the column containing nominal time. If
given, it will put the column quite far left.}

\item{row}{A row counter column. This will be the first column in
the dataset.}

\item{debug}{Start by calling browser()?}
}
\description{
Order the columns in a data.frame for easy export to Nonmem. Standard
columns like "ROW", "ID", "NTIM", etc. will be first by default, then other
capital case named columns, then lowercase named columns (one or more
lowercase letter means that column is sorted as lowercase). Except for
columns mentioned in "first" and "last" arguments, columns are sorted
alphabetically (after by case). In short, priority is 1: Case, first/last,
alphabetical. This means that last="BW" will put body weight as last of
capital, but before lowercase columns.

\details{
This function will change the order of columns but it
    will never edit values in any columns.
