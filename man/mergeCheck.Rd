\item{df2}{A data.frame that will be merged onto df1.}

\item{debug}{Start by calling browser()?}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to merge. If all is among them, an
error will be returned.}
}
\value{

\description{
So far, this one can only check that we get the same no of rows as the first
df supplied. It is likely that much faster, better and prettier functions
are available out there. But for 95% of the author's merges, this does
exactly the checks and ordering, he wants. And it only uses base R.
