# pmxtricks
This package provides some of the author's personal shortcuts and tricks in the
everyday work as a pharmacometrician working with R and Nonmem. The package is
still not stable. When that said, it contains very useful things.

One function the author has not been able to find anywhere else is called
NMscanData which automatically finds and reads tables generated by Nonmem,
merges with input data (the data submitted to Nonmem), and creates a
standardised representation.
