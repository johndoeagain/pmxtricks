** Bugs
*** NMscanData
**** TODO If col.row is not supplied, the function fails
***** DONE As of now, It must report an error since col.row is always necessary.
      CLOSED: [2019-01-24 Thu 18:39]
***** TODO Ideally, it just treats output tables if tab.row not found
*** TODO theme_pp doesn't run
*** NMreadRun
**** TODO No. of parameters 
extload sometimes fails to get FIX info creating problems for
determining no of estimated parameters.
*** signif2

Must be suitable for batch mode.
NMcompAllRes
*** TODO Read Nonmem data rds files if available and up2date, if not create
    Could be an option to NMscan. For now, it's a new function called
    NMcompRes.     
*** TODO Function to add columns to all elements in a scanned data obj
*** TODO Individual profile plots
*** TODO Check nonmem data set
**** Checks/analyses to include
**** NA TIME
**** actual time since first dose vs Nominal time since first dose
**** actual time since last dose vs Nominal time since nominal dose
**** all subjects have doses?
**** All subjects have observations?
**** Negative actual time (since first or previous dose) when corresponding nominal time is neg
**** negative doses
**** Nomminal dose vs actual dose
** Documentation
*** TODO Tests
** Improvements
*** mergeCheck
**** TODO base check on actual rows
mergeCheck counts number of rows in df1 and df3. This is not entirely safe in
case all.x=F. It can happen that rows have no match, and others have multiple
matches, and that the resulting number of rows happen to be the same as for df1.

In stead, add a row counter to df1. Look in df3 whether all values of the row
counter are there, and that no of rows is retained.
*** NMreadTab
**** TODO Option to use colnames for all subtables?
With the current implementation, this would make processing extremely much slower.
**** TODO Check if correct seperator chosen
**** TODO Use fread rather than readLines
Enourmous performance gain for large tables. Especially for VPC's this is necessary. 
*** NMrunLog
**** TODO Add convergence info
**** TODO Add Covariance step info
**** TODO Add dataset name

*** gg_theme

This function is dead. If at all relevant, this will be developed in a separate package.

*** NMscanData
**** TODO check if .mod file exists
Right now it is assumed. But check for it. And if a new argument "dir.data" is
given, it is not needed.
**** TODO Clean up messages
Messages seem a bit random. Maybe introduce a quiet option?
*** trapez
**** DONE strategy for cumulative auc
     CLOSED: [2019-10-24 Thu 14:18]
One shorter than x and y. 
**** DONE Why not just pass the na.rm to sum/cumsum?
     CLOSED: [2019-10-24 Thu 14:19]
No, cumsum does not support na.rm
*** NMcompRes
If an rds exists but was called with other options, it is still
used. That is risky. Maybe save all options to function call in
object? Or compare with the meta data object?
